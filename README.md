# Building a social network is a complex project that would require a lot of time and resources to develop. However, I can provide you with an outline of the main features you would need to consider implementing:

Hostel Selection:

Create a form or survey to collect information from students about which hostel they belong to.

Store this information in a database and group students based on their hostel.

Secure Login and Signup:

Create a secure login and signup page that requires students to enter their email address and password.

Hash the password using a strong hashing algorithm to protect the user's information.

Profile Page:

Allow students to create and customize their profile pages with their name, picture, and other relevant information.

Provide privacy settings that allow students to choose who can see their profile information.

Social Features:

Allow students to connect with each other and send friend requests.

Implement a news feed where students can share updates, photos, and other content with their friends.

Include features for liking and commenting on posts.

Map Feature:

Provide a map of the university that shows the location of each hostel and other important landmarks.

Allow students to enter their location and get directions to their destination.
